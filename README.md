# Steps
    * Create a js file (ex. 'myModule.js').
    * 'module.exports' is an object that will hold the code to be exported.
    * Create an 'index.js' file.
    * In the index.js file, write 'const myModule = require('./myModule.js).
    * Now in the index.js file you can run code from myModule.js by typing `myModule.${code}`.
    * Check for dependencies located in package.JSON file.
    * `npm i` to install said dependencies. 
    * You can then run index.js in your terminal to import the module.
